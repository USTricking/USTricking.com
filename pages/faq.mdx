# How To Start a Tricking Gathering 

    1. Identify the TYPE of event you want to host.
        - Will it be instructional based, like a camp?
        - Is it a banger event where everyone’s just trying to train and throw down?
        - Is this a competition type event with battles?

        This tends to incorporate your WHY - are you looking to bring people together and 
        grow your community? Are you looking to bring out the best of everyone with a competition?

    2. Determine the amenities you will provide.
        - How much session time will there be?
        - Are there seminars? Battles?
        - Overnight stay? Hotels?
        - Are you providing meals? On which days and times?
        - Are you including shirts or merch of some sort?
        - Are you picking people up from the airport? Who’s driving?

    3. Rough Out An Itinerary For How You’d Like the Weekend to Go
        - When is check in? 
        - What is happening when?

    4. Find a Location
        - Will you host this at a gymnastics center? Cheer? Martial arts?
        - Establish a relationship with the owner if you don’t already have one. 
        Call them and say you’re looking to rent space to host an event. If they’re open to the idea, give them a rundown 
        of the itinerary and what you will need from them, as well as what you’re going to provide them with. 
        Expect to pay anywhere from $500 - $3,500 to rent for a few hours vs a whole weekend respectively.

    5. Determine A Budget
        - Use your amenities list and your talk with the owner to determine what your total expenses will look like. 
        Add an additional 20-50% for unexpected expenses - nothing ever goes perfectly to plan.
        - Take the total budget and add on the profit in dollar amounts that you’d like to make (if any). 
        Divide this by the number of people you think you can realistically get to this event. 
        This will be a ballpark for your ticket price.

    6. Begin Networking For Special Guests
        - The special guests are the bread and butter for most events. People want to come to events to train 
        with athletes they don’t normally get to. A good way to attract “higher level” guests is to offer 
        them compensation for their expenses and potentially a stipend on top of that (basically, extra money to make them happy).

    7. Establish A Marketing Timeline and Materials
        - Create a flyer, along with a Facebook page or website to direct traffic to, and 
        which contains the information people will need to get to your event.
        - You should start promoting AT LEAST six months ahead of time. 
        This gives attendants time to make plans and start saving for the expense.
        - Determine what platforms you will promote on and utilize the special guests for marketing as well.
        - Get in touch with US Tricking to have the representatives share your event to their platforms.

    8. Identify Persons Who Can Act As Staff Members
        - Running an event of any kind takes plenty of coordination between its many moving parts. 
        Find a few people (ideally 3-6) who are good communicators and whom you trust who 
        can carry out different functions of the event, like check-in / registration, 
        travel coordinators, first aid specialists, etc. 
        - Create some sort of agreement with them, whether verbal or written. Consider paying them for their time or at the very least,
         admitting them to the event for free. Be warned 
            - hiring other trickers is not always ideal, especially if they do not share the 
            same vision you do and may be likely to get distracted easily by the excitement of the event.

    9. Streamline Communication With Your Attendants
        - Potential attendants, or parents of attendants may have questions that aren’t answered by your website / flyer. 
        How will they get in contact with you? Email, facebook message, text, etc.
        - Try to choose one or two methods and be consistent so you don’t experience headaches 
        later trying to remember which platform you communicated with who about what.

    10. Set Up A Ticket / Registration System
        - Many website builders have event registration / ticketing functions built in. 
        This is a crucial step because you will want to be able to sell tickets ahead of time to bring 
        in revenue that you may need before the actual event.
        - If you’re not sure how to get started, reach out to US Tricking for ideas.
        - You do not necessarily need a separate bank account for this, though it would be a really 
        good idea for when your event starts to grow. It also does not cost anything to set up a separate bank account.

    11. Devise An Action Plan That Follows The Itinerary
        - This Action Plan will essentially bring your itinerary and staff together. 
        Looking at the itinerary, what actions will need to be done, when should they be done, 
        and who will do them? What materials will be needed?
        - This could be a notebook or a google drive document - doesn’t need to be super complicated. 
        This just needs to be some kind of document that gives an overview of what, when, by who, and how.

    12. Stay Consistent With Your Marketing 
        - Do NOT hit the ground running and then fizzle out because you don’t get a
         million registrations the first week. Many trickers are procrastinators 
         and the internet is also a huge place. 
        - Stay consistent with your message and advertisements and constantly direct them back to your website or facebook page.

    13. Set Up Regular Meetings With Your Staff
        - Could be once a month, could be once a week. As your event draws closer, it’s important to 
        stay in close communication with the owner of the facility, your staff, and your guests. 
        Important things should be discussed and hammered out prior to the event, rather than hoping 
        and praying it will all work out. Events are not overly complicated to run, they just need to 
        be scheduled well and good communication should be maintained.

    14. Host Your Event!
        - Have a blast, remember to drink water and take a break when you need it, and most importantly, STICK TO YOUR PLAN.
